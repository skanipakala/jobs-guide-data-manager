# ReadMe for Jobs Guide App


## About the Data üìä

- The Flutter app (jobs.dbknews.com) reads the jobs guide data from `.json` files
- Here's what each file means.

| Exported File  | What it does |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `sample_metadata.json`  | Contains all data about all unqiue, departments, units, and workgroups   |
| `sample_year.json`  | Actual wage data segregated by years (2018-latest). This is main source of data for jobs guide   |
| `departmentToUnit.json`  | Complementary file to help quick lookups of all the units within a specific department. These are used to help update the __unit dropdown filter__ with only the necessary units when a department filter is set.   |
| `unitToWorkgroup.json`  | Similar to `departmentToUnit.json` but this file helps for quick lookups of all workgroups with a specific unit. These are used to help update the __workgroup dropdown filter__ with only the necessary workgroups when a unit filter is set.  |
| `unit_reviews.json`  | List of reviews for each unit. Contains min/max wages, reported wage, job title, and review description   |

## Updating Wage Data üí∞
- These are steps to update the data for a new year (i.e 2023 data)

### Generating new `.json` files with new excel data
1. Acquire the new year data via FOIA request
2. Navigate to `/imports` folder and add open the `student_wages_tags.xlsx` file
3. You should see sheets for different years from 2018 - 2022 data.
4. Copy your data into a new sheet called `2023` or whatever your year is and save + close Excel
5. Navigate to `/scripts` folder
6. Append your year `2023` to the `years` array. 
    - Should look like this --> `years = ['2018', '2019', '2020', '2021', '2022', '2023']`
7. To install all the depencies run. Ensure you have python installed first.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
8. Now run the file `updateWageData.py` with the command
 ```
 python updateWageData.py
 ```
9. This will re-create all wage data related `.json` files and store them in `/exports` folder.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è  `unit_reviews.json` will not be updated. You must run `python updateReviews.py` for this


## Updating Review Data üí¨
- Follow these steps to update student reviews
1. Download the latest review data from this google sheet. Make sure to check the sheet called `cleaned`
2. Navigate to `/scripts/`
3. Copy your updated excel file, replacing `responses.xlsx` (keep the file name the same)
4. Run the python script to generate `unit_reviews.json` inside the `/exports` folder
```
python updateReviews.py
```
5. Entries in the `unit_reviews.json` should be in the following structure:
```json
{"A. James Clark School of Engineering": {
        "wage_range": {
            "min": 9.25,
            "max": 15.0

    ```
    This will open your browser. Log into Google with dbklab credentials. You can redirect back after this.
