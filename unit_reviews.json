Includes 5 office hours, 2 discussion sections to teach, class attendance, slide prep for weekly discussion sections (which you can get from someone who previously was a TA for the class), and grading/entering quizzes into elms/canvas. Also need to proctor exams throughout the semester. I have loved and enjoyed the experience because it is fantastic prep for the FAR section of the CPA exam. It also helps you get ready for the work world and the ability to explain accounting concepts to people with no prior experience with accounting. It is more work than other TA jobs (I am basing this off my friends who TA for different classes) but I enjoy doing it so I really don't mind the extra work.",

Other weird expectations were to stay at the desk if the next community assist at (CA) did not show up, and that requirement came with no limit, and no excuses, meaning you could be fired for abandoning the desk even if your shift was over, and you had class etc. However these kind of situations hardly ever came up, and it was mostly a very chill job that allowed me to do homework and still make some extra cash.

I really enjoy my time on shift, especially because of my peers.\nHowever, the professional staff are terrible. They do not care about students. The majority of professional staff actively fight against raising our wages. In my position specifically, we have been threatened with shift and staff cuts because some supervisors were on their phones more than pro staff liked. There are very contentious relationships between pro staff and student staff; we aren't treated like real workers, instead like children who can't properly care for a building.\nI am very reluctant to interact with male staff at times because of the awful encounters so many of the female staff have had with men in Eppley.\nMost of the students are great; the professional staff are god awful.",
