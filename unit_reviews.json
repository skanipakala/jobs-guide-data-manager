It also helps you get ready for the work world and the ability to explain accounting concepts to people with no prior experience with accounting.

The processes of checking out keys, swipes, and packages are confusing to learn (because it\u2019s unnecessarily complicated), but once you do it\u2019s easy. The rest of the shift you can do whatever you want like homework or Netflix. The worst part are the graves. You have to work one every two weeks, between midnight and 9am. If you get stuck with a 3am to 6am, good luck trying to keep a normal schedule the next day. This job is good for night owls looking for easy money.",

There's some room for growth, too, within my position, which makes me feel good about the progress I make at work. I really enjoy my time on shift, especially because of my peers.\nHowever, the professional staff are terrible. They do not care about students. The majority of professional staff actively fight against raising our wages. In my position specifically, we have been threatened with shift and staff cuts because some supervisors were on their phones more than pro staff liked. There are very contentious relationships between pro staff and student staff; we aren't treated like real workers, instead like children who can't properly care for a building.\nI am very reluctant to interact with male staff at times because of the awful encounters so many of the female staff have had with men in Eppley.\nMost of the students are great; the professional staff are god awful.",

When you first start, it can seem overwhelming but I promise it's worth it. That being said, as you get promoted to supervisor and take on leadership roles within the department, you get to see a lot under the cover. The professional staff who oversee RecWell are extremely opinionated and selfish for their own students, and often do not work together when it's needed most which is disheartening. Good work schedule flexibility and pay, but be prepared to deal with a high level of interpersonal politics.",
